# Set pnpm as the default package manager
# This ensures that 'npm install' or 'yarn install' will not be used by mistake.
# For pnpm, this file is often not strictly necessary, but it helps enforce consistency.
# If you want to enforce pnpm, you can use a preinstall script in package.json or a postinstall script.

# For now, we'll just ensure pnpm is used by running pnpm commands directly.
# This file is being created for completeness, but its primary function is often for npm/yarn.
